Find the Number of Groups of "1" in a Matrix
Problem: Given a matrix, each cell of the matrix is either "1" or "0". Consider that all the adjacent "1" form a group,
find out how many such groups are in the matrix.  By"adjacent",  we mean a cell's left, right, up and down. 
The diagonal is not considered as "adjacent". For example, if we have a matrix as follow:

1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0

then the output will be 2. There are two groups of "1" here.
