Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree 
Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, 
write a program to find the least common ancestor.

(Using Single Traversal)
The method 1 finds LCA in O(n) time, but requires three tree traversals plus extra spaces for path arrays. 
If we assume that the keys n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using single traversal of Binary Tree 
and without extra storage for path arrays.
The idea is to traverse the tree starting from root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root, 
then root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, 
we recur for left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in right 
subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.

/* Program to find LCA of n1 and n2 using one traversal of Binary Tree */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// A Binary Tree Node
struct Node
{
    struct Node *left, *right;
    int key;
};
 
// Utility function to create a new tree Node
Node* newNode(int key)
{
    Node *temp = new Node;
    temp->key = key;
    temp->left = temp->right = NULL;
    return temp;
}
 
// This function returns pointer to LCA of two given values n1 and n2.
// This function assumes that n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree
struct Node *findLCA(struct Node* root, int n1, int n2)
{
    // Base case
    if (root == NULL) return NULL;
 
    // If either n1 or n2 matches with root's key, report
    // the presence by returning root (Note that if a key is
    // ancestor of other, then the ancestor key becomes LCA
    if (root->key == n1 || root->key == n2)
        return root;
 
    // Look for keys in left and right subtrees
    Node *left_lca  = findLCA(root->left, n1, n2);
    Node *right_lca = findLCA(root->right, n1, n2);
 
    // If both of the above calls return Non-NULL, then one key
    // is present in once subtree and other is present in other,
    // So this node is the LCA
    if (left_lca && right_lca)  return root;
 
    // Otherwise check if left subtree or right subtree is LCA
    return (left_lca != NULL)? left_lca: right_lca;
}

Time Complexity: Time complexity of the above solution is O(n) as the method does a simple tree traversal in bottom up fashion.
Note that the above method assumes that keys are present in Binary Tree. If one key is present and other is absent, then it returns the present key as LCA (Ideally should have returned NULL).
We can extend this method to handle all cases by passing two boolean variables v1 and v2. v1 is set as true when n1 is present in tree and v2 is set as true if n2 is present in tree.

/* Program to find LCA of n1 and n2 using one traversal of Binary Tree.
   It handles all cases even when n1 or n2 is not there in Binary Tree */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// A Binary Tree Node

{
    struct Node *left, *right;
    int key;

// Utility function to create a new tree Node
Node* newNode(int key)

    Node *temp = new Node;
    temp->key = key;
    temp->left = temp->right = NULL;
    return temp;
}
 
// This function returns pointer to LCA of two given values n1 and n2.
// v1 is set as true by this function if n1 is found
// v2 is set as true by this function if n2 is found
struct Node *findLCAUtil(struct Node* root, int n1, int n2, bool &v1, bool &v2)
{
    // Base case
    if (root == NULL) return NULL;
 
    // If either n1 or n2 matches with root's key, report the presence
    // by setting v1 or v2 as true and return root (Note that if a key
    // is ancestor of other, then the ancestor key becomes LCA)
    if (root->key == n1)
    {
        v1 = true;
        return root;
    }
    if (root->key == n2)
    {
        v2 = true;
        return root;
    }
 
    // Look for keys in left and right subtrees
    Node *left_lca  = findLCAUtil(root->left, n1, n2, v1, v2);
    Node *right_lca = findLCAUtil(root->right, n1, n2, v1, v2);
 
    // If both of the above calls return Non-NULL, then one key
    // is present in once subtree and other is present in other,
    // So this node is the LCA
    if (left_lca && right_lca)  return root;
 
    // Otherwise check if left subtree or right subtree is LCA
    return (left_lca != NULL)? left_lca: right_lca;

    if (root->key == k || find(root->left, k) ||  find(root->right, k))

    // Else return false
    return false;

// This function returns LCA of n1 and n2 only if both n1 and n2 are present
// in tree, otherwise returns NULL;

{
    // Initialize n1 and n2 as not visited
    bool v1 = false, v2 = false;
 
    // Find lca of n1 and n2 using the technique discussed above
    Node *lca = findLCAUtil(root, n1, n2, v1, v2);
 
    // Return LCA only if both n1 and n2 are present in tree

    if (lca != NULL)
       cout << "LCA(4, 5) = " << lca->key;
    else
       cout << "Keys are not present ";
 
    lca =  findLCA(root, 4, 10);
    if (lca != NULL)

If we are given a BST where every node has parent pointer, then LCA can be easily determined by traversing up using parent 
pointer and printing the first intersecting node.

We can solve this problem using BST properties. We can recursively traverse the BST from root. 
The main idea of the solution is, while traversing from top to bottom, the first node n we encounter with value 
between n1 and n2, i.e., n1 < n < n2 or same as one of the n1 or n2, is LCA of n1 and n2 (assuming that n1 < n2). 
So just recursively traverse the BST in, if node's value is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies in left side of 
the node, if it's is smaller than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies on right side. Otherwise root is LCA 
(assuming that both n1 and n2 are present in BST)

/* Function to find LCA of n1 and n2. The function assumes that both
   n1 and n2 are present in BST */
struct node *lca(struct node* root, int n1, int n2)
{
    while (root != NULL)
    {
         // If both n1 and n2 are smaller than root, then LCA lies in left
        if (root->data > n1 && root->data > n2)
           root = root->left;
 
        // If both n1 and n2 are greater than root, then LCA lies in right
        else if (root->data < n1 && root->data < n2)
           root = root->right;
 
        else break;
    }
    return root;
}
