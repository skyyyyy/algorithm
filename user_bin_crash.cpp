User Bin Crash problem
Problem: This is a problem from facebook buzz. The problem is that a plane is gong to crash,  
you need to throw out W lbs of freight to survive the crash. Each type of freight fi is associated with a weight wi and price pi.
If we throw one unit of fi out, we lost pi but the plane becomes lighter by wi. 
Our mission is to throw out minmum freights measured by their aggregate price and avoid the crash, 
which means the total weight of those freights should be larger than W.
